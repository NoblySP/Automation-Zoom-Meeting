# Automation-Zoom-Meeting
Join a Zoom Meeting Automatically without clicking anything

-------------

### Introduction
Tired of clicking the Zoom icon, then clicking the join button, then typing the meeting ID and Password and then finally clicking the join meeting button and not to mention all the time you have to wait in between these steps?

This python script automates all these tedious tasks to save you many many seconds of your time!


### Setup
- Make sure that there is a Zoom icon/shortcut on the Desktop

- Ensure that `all_icons` and `meetings_automation.py` are in the same folder on your device

### Usage
1. Run the meetings_automation.py file. 
1. Input the Meeting Id and then the Meeting Password


### Todo
- [ ] Stop the program after a certain time if the specified image is not found on the screen within that time period, so that it does not run indefinitely.

- [ ] Use os module to find the Zoom application instead of searching for the Zoom application icon on the Desktop
